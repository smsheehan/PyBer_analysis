# PyBer_analysis



## Overview of the analysis: 

Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate ride-sharing data from the fictional ride-share company, PyBer.  Specifically, our fictional CEO was interested in understanding if any business insights could be gleaned through evaluation of the relationships between city type, fares, and number of drivers.  Additionally, since our data contains detailed information about the date of each individual ride, we were asked to evaluate the data temporally over the first trimester of 2019.  From a skills standpoint, this purpose of this challenge was to explore merging two data sets, demonstrate proficiency with utilization of the groupby() function, and to introduce us to two new functions: pivot() and resample(). 

## Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.


## Summary: 
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
